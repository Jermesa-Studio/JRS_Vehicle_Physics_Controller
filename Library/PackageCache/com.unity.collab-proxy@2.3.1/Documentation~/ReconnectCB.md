# Connect Unity Cloud Build

Unity Cloud Build is a [continuous integration](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.2/Documentation/Manual/UnityCloudBuild.html#automated-build-generation) that automatically creates multiplatform builds in the Cloud in minutes. You can point Cloud Build toward your version control system to:

* Automate new builds
* Build faster
* Catch problems earlier
* Iterate on your builds more efficiently with agility.

To get started, see [Pay as you go with Cloud Build](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.2/Documentation/Manual/UnityCloudBuildMeteredBilling.html).
