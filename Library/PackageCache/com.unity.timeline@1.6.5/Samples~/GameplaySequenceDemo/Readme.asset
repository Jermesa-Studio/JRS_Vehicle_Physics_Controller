  title: Timeline Gameplay Sequence Demo
  sections:
  - heading: Overview
    text: This sample demonstrates how Timeline can be used to create a small in-game
      moment, using built-in Timeline tracks. In this example, we have a Player character
      jogging and then colliding with another character. The Player character represents
      our gameplay character and is using a looping jog animation. The Timeline then
      takes control of the player character, collides with the other character, then
      returns to his original gameplay animation (jog) once the Timeline has finished.
      Note that the gameplay animation is driven by an Animator and will only play
      at runtime. The character will be in a T-Stance pose for the runtime portion
      when using the Timeline Preview.

      your headset on!), Control and Marker track.'

  - heading: Timeline Structure
    text: 'The GameplaySequence Timeline has been organized in the following
      groups: Building, Lights, Cameras, Characters, Audio and Props. These are explained
      in detail below.'

  - heading: Building group
    text: The Building group contains two Control tracks. The Building Spawn track
      which spawns the building prefab, and the Building Particles track that controls
      two particle systems in the scene; ElectricalSparks and SandSwirlsEffect.

  - heading: Lights group
    text: The Lights group contains two Animation tracks; one for the Sun light,
      and the other for flickering Point light. Both tracks where animated in Unity
      and the curves can be seen by enabling the curves icon or double clicking on
      the track to open the Animation window. The Sun light is animated in Rotation
      (sunrise) and the Point light has a spiked Intensity curve.

  - heading: Cameras group
    text: "The Cameras group contains two Cameras; the Main camera using an Animation
      track, and the Follow Camera using an Activation track. The Main Camera has
      an animation curve for the continuous movement (can be seen by enabling the
      curves icon) + two override tracks (expand arrow on Main Camera track), one
      for each character. The clips on the override tracks have static values for
      a fixed camera shot. The Follow Camera is simply parented child of the Player
      character\u2019s root and activated for the follow-cam shots."

  - heading: Characters group
    text: "The first track is an Animation track for the Player character. Notice
      that clip\u2019s pre and post extrapolations are set to None, meaning the character
      will not be influenced by the Timeline during these gaps. At runtime, these
      gaps mean the Player character will be using his Animator state, jog. The second
      track is an Activation track for the second character, making his appear in
      the scene. The third and last track is an Animation track for the second character.
      On this track, the second character blends from one clip tp another creating
      a cinematic sequence. "

  - heading: Audio group
    text: This group contains four Audio tracks; Player, crickets, neon-light & character2
      tracks. The Player track has a jog/breathing and bump clip. The crickets track
      has pan and volume animation curves (can be seen by enabling the curves icon).
      The neon-light sound is for the flickering Point light. The Character2 tracks
      contains all audio clips for this second character.

  - heading: Props group
    text: The Props group animates the Table and the Can. The first Activation track
      makes the Table appear in the scene. The second Activation track makes a static
      version of the can appear in the scene. The third track is an Animation track
      that animates the table bump animation. The last track is a Control track with
      a sub-timeline for the can animation. The static version of the can is disabled
      and replaced with the animated version when the Control clip starts. Double
      clicking the Control track clip will enter the Can Sub-Timeline, leaving a
      breadcrumb at the top of the Timeline window.

    url:
  - heading: Can Sub-Timeline
    text: 'This sub-timeline contains an Animation track for the Can rolling off
      the table and bouncing on the ground, an Audio track for the sounds effects
      and a Control track for the liquid particles splashing out of the can. '
    linkText:
    url:
  - heading: Marker track
    text: "In the Timeline window, under the time ruler, there is a Marker track
      with one Signal at frame 1200. This is the Signal marker that triggers the
      jog audio clip on the Player once the Timeline finished and gameplay \u201Cjog\u201D
      resumes."
